# Rank Everything

## Overview

Rank Everything is a site to do exactly what it's name suggests – rank EVERYTHING. 

Created in Ruby on Rails

## Using the Site

The homepage shows the user one item – it could be anything. Spaghetti. The scene in Lord of the Rings where the orc yells "Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!". My first grade teacher, Ms. Hufnagel. 

They can give it a thumbs up if they like it, or thumbs down if they don't. Once voted on, the item disappears and a new one shows up.

So where does the ranking come in? Well, the percentage of positive reviews that each thing recieves gives it a percentage value, which is then used to rank it against all other things.

The top 50 list is available in the top menu, as well as a link to add a new item that is missing from the list.
